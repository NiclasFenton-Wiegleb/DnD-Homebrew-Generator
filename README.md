# DnD Homebrew Generator

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create an AI pipeline that can ingest stories and output all the building blocks for a DnD Homebrew campaign. There are several modules involved in the process that will segment the narrative into different locations and characters, while other modules generate encounters.
